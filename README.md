The goal was to create a .Net project by building a dynamic app using ASPX, C# and SQL Server. First, the user needs to register where they will be inactive by default. The user should then access the "gestao.aspx" page, where as a manager, they will approve the user by changing their status to active. Only after approval, the user can then log in on the "login.aspx" page.

On the login page, the user will have the option to log in, where they will be redirected to the "app.aspx" page. Alternatively, they can choose the recovery option, where they will have the opportunity to recover their password on the "recover.aspx" page and receive an email with the new decrypted password.

Furthermore, on the "app.aspx" page, there is also the option to change the password, redirecting the user to the "alterar.aspx" page. Alternatively, they can enter the "manage users" page, redirecting them to the "gestao.aspx" page.
